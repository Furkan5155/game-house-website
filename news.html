            <p>Brace yourself to encounter the biggest threat Kyle Crane has ever faced. Meet the Baron: an emotionless, 
                calculating, but brilliant scientist. Convinced that the remnants of humanity who survived the outbreak are weak, 
                he sees it as his moral right and highest duty to restore order. To achieve this, he's deep into experimenting 
                with sinister virus strains, pursuing his grand design and justifying it by claiming to serve the greater good. <br><br>
                After 13 long years of suffering, it will become clear why Kyle Crane’s thirst for revenge is so intense. 
                With the fate of survivors and factions in the Castor Woods valley hanging in the balance, the legendary hero 
                must use his beastlike powers with the risk of becoming the very monster he despises. <br><br>
                Each area will be meticulously designed and uniquely different. The post-apocalyptic open world will come 
                alive with small, detailed touches in the new interiors, dynamic weather changes and new locations like 
                the Swamps or the Baron’s Laboratory. But there's more to this place than meets the eye. <br><br>
                Wishlist the game now to discover what those things might be and get ready to unleash the beast in Summer 2025.
